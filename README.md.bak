Go to project root directory
Run NPM Install

To publish and install packages to and from the public npm registry or a private npm registry, you must install Node.js and the npm command line interface using either a Node version manager or a Node installer. We strongly recommend using a Node version manager like nvm to install Node.js and npm. We do not recommend using a Node installer, since the Node installation process installs npm in a directory with local permissions and can cause permissions errors when you run npm packages globally.

Note: to download the latest version of npm, on the command line, run the following command:

npm install -g npm

To see if you already have Node.js and npm installed and check the installed version, run the following commands:

node -v
npm -v
Using a Node version manager to install Node.js and npm
Node version managers allow you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm on your system so you can test your applications on multiple versions of npm to ensure they work for users on different versions.

OSX or Linux Node version managers
nvm
n
Windows Node version managers
nodist
nvm-windows
